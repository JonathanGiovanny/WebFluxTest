# WebFluxTest
Create Basic Webflux endpoints

## Personal Results c:
- R2dbc does not support yet the same amount of Codecs, for example: UUID
- R2dbc does not support ORM, which means no hibernate and all the functionality that it involves.
- R2dbc does not support relationships, at least on spring annotations, which means no relational databases :)

Then, when to use Webflux?
+ Small project.
+ Little resources.
+ Not intensive computational proccessing.
+ Non Relational Database.
